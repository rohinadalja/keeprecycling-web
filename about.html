                <h4><strong>Who am I?</strong></h4>
                <p>Hello everyone! I am Rohin Adalja (23 y.o). I reside in the “hat” on top of the United States of America (also known to some as Canada.)  Prior to OSU, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience and Immunology at University of Toronto. During my undergraduate, my job with a tech company motivated me to pursue Computer Science full time. I decided to jump into computing because I found myself wanting to be part of the booming computing field upon graduation.
                <h4 class="padding-between-small"><strong>My Interests</strong></h4>
                <p>I have always had a strong interest in CS ever since I was young. I still remember making my first “Hello Kitty” themed website (don’t judge) when I was 10 in Yahoo GeoCities (for those who remember).  I had an interest in coding ever since my first C++ programming class in high school. I also remember getting into Visual Basics and making some simple .exe programs during my time in high school.</p>
                <h4 class="padding-between-small"><strong>My History</strong></h4>
                <p>Back in Toronto and prior to joining OSU, I was also involved in several causes including providing food and aid at a nearby homeless shelter as well as taking care of elderly with Dementia at a Toronto long term care centre. In addition to this, I was also briefly volunteering at the nearby hospital for Sick Children Research Centre (Cardiac research) while I was pursuing my Neurosci major.</p>
                <p>More recently after obtaining my first Bachelor’s degree, I had the opportunity of working with a tech firm seeking to incorporate machine learning within a Canadian city municipality’s water distribution and waste-water systems to increase automation and reduce cost of operation for the city.</p>
                <p>My interest in the field of computer science and machine learning evolved from my limited workplace exposure; that is what motivated me to go back to school and pursue this second degree. I went with OSU for my CS post-baccalaureate because I feel that it offers a very streamlined pathway into the field, barring any electives unrelated to the field. Apart from academics, I am fond of reading novels in my free time. I also play sports, mainly Soccer, and I am currently learning to play the keyboard on the side.
                </p>
